# ðŸŽµ Speech Augmentation for ASR Task Based on NeMo Toolkit
This repository provides a set of audio perturbations for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), designed to work with NVIDIA NeMo 1.6.2.
All augmentations operate directly on AudioSegment objects.

# ðŸ”¬ Our Contribution: FadeOutIn Perturbation

FadeOutIn (a.k.a. FadeInOutPerturbation) is a novel augmentation proposed in this work.

Idea: Speech loudness depends on the amplitude envelope, which decays with distance.
Implementation: Random segments are selected; each fades out smoothly and then fades in again.

Advantage:
More realistic than hard time masking
Retains partial spectral information
Simulates speakerâ€“microphone movement
Improves model robustness to recording conditions
